        <p> I am an aspiring software engineer living in Brooklyn, New York. I am a Forensic Science graduate who later found herself in a Clinical Laboratory Setting. Working in the lab has inspired me to think about problem solving and troubleshooting. Eventually, I started working on VB script and started to learn about coding and software engineering.

        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p> I came to the U.S in 2009 from Bangladesh and started living in Brooklyn and Queens. After high school, I went to college and I chose forensic science because science was always interesting to me. After I graduated from college I started working at a Toxicology laboratory. Now I am helping with method validation process. I loved working with my hands and solving problems but I was looking for further growth in my career. </p>
        <br> <!--created break in the page-->
        <p> So, I started researching about what I should do next and I realized that I enjoyed fixing the script issues at work. Since I liked problem-solving, software engineering seemed like a great idea, especially with remote work being an option. Eventually, I came across Thinkful and decided that would be a great way to learn a new skill. </p>
